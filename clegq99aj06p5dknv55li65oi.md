JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used primarily in web browsers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. To execute JavaScript code, a JavaScript engine is needed.

A JavaScript engine is a program that reads and executes JavaScript code. It is responsible for parsing the code, generating bytecode or machine code, and executing the code.

The JavaScript engine typically runs in the browser and is responsible for executing the JavaScript code that is embedded in web pages. However, there are also server-side JavaScript engines that run outside of the browser, such as Node.js.

The JavaScript engine provides several important features that make JavaScript a powerful and flexible language. These include:

1. **Memory management:** The engine manages memory allocation and deallocation, which is important for ensuring that JavaScript programs run efficiently and without memory leaks.
    
2. **Garbage collection:** The engine automatically detects and removes objects that are no longer needed, which helps to free up memory and prevent memory leaks.
    
3. **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation:** The engine can compile JavaScript code into machine code on-the-fly, which can significantly improve the performance of JavaScript programs.
    
4. **Optimizations:** The engine can optimize the execution of JavaScript code by reordering instructions, inlining functions, and other techniques that improve performance.
    

Overall, the JavaScript engine is an essential component of the modern web platform, and its performance and capabilities continue to improve over time.
