Client-server architecture is a model for designing distributed systems in which programs on client computers request services or resources from server programs running on a central server. The client sends a request to the server for a particular resource, and the server responds to the request by providing the requested service or data.

In this architecture, client and server components can be deployed on different machines connected through a network. The client-side component sends a request to the server-side component, which processes the request, performs the necessary operations or tasks, and sends back the result to the client.

The client-server architecture has many benefits, including allowing for scalability, as multiple clients can connect to a single server, and the system can grow by adding more servers or resources as needed. It also allows for separation of concerns, where client-side code can focus on displaying data and user interactions, while server-side code can focus on data processing and business logic.

The client-server model is widely used in various contexts, including web applications, databases, email systems, and network protocols. Some examples of client-server architecture in practice include the HTTP protocol used for web browsing, the email protocol SMTP, and database systems like MySQL, MSSQL, and Oracle.
