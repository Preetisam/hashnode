"Binding early" is a concept and a technique used in JavaScript functions where you explicitly bind a function to a certain context or object early, so you don't need to bind it again later. This is often used to avoid unnecessary performance overhead by preventing the function from being re-bound multiple times.

In JavaScript, functions are **first-class citizens** and can be passed around as values to other functions or objects. *When you pass a function to another object or function, its context changes to that object or function, which may cause unexpected behavior*. To prevent this, you can use the `bind()` method to explicitly bind the function to the original context or object.

For example, letâ€™s consider a function `myFunction()` that needs to be bound to a certain context:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  console.log(this.x);
}

// Create an object
const myObj = {
  x: 42
};

// Bind myFunction to myObj
const myBoundFunction = myFunction.bind(myObj);

// Now, the value of "this" inside myBoundFunction will refer to myObj
myBoundFunction(); // output: 42
```

In this example, we bind the `myFunction()` function to `myObj` using the `bind()` method. Now, when we call `myBoundFunction()`, it has a `this` value of `myObj` and logs the value of `myObj.x`.

By binding functions early, you can avoid redundant binding and improve the performance of your JavaScript code.

In React, if you have a function that doesn't rely on any component state or props, you can bind it outside of the component and pass it as a prop instead of creating a new function on every render. This can help improve the performance since the function won't be recreated every time the component re-renders.

Here's an example of how to bind a function outside a React component and pass it as a prop:

```javascript
function MyComponent({ handleClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
  );
}

function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked');
}

// Bind handleClick function outside component
const boundHandleClick = handleClick.bind(this);

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent handleClick={boundHandleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `handleClick` the function is bound outside of `MyComponent` and passed as a prop called `handleClick`. This way, `handleClick` won't be recreated every time `MyComponent` re-renders, which can lead to better performance.
