First a quick overview of the built-in functionalities and available libraries, then I'll help you understand what is better for your use case (down in the comments).  
  
Using the setState()/useState Function:  
  
The first way to manage the state is to use the built-in useState() hook. This function is called whenever you want to update the state of your React component. It takes two parameters: the new state and an optional callback function. The callback function is executed after the new state has been applied.  
  
This approach is not global and allows managing the state only at the component level, by passing it down with props to other components.  
  
Using a Built-in React Context Provider and Context Consumer:  
  
The second way to manage the state is to use a built-in context. This approach is similar to using the useState() function, but it provides a more global way to manage the state of your React component.

Using Redux:

The third way to manage the state is to use Redux. Redux is a state management library for React applications that provides a more structured and predictable way to manage the state of your application.

The basic concept of Redux involves having a single store that holds the entire state of your application, and then using actions to update that state. Actions are simple objects that describe what happened in your application. These actions get dispatched to a reducer function that actually updates the state in the store.

Redux can be a bit more complex to set up and use than the other options listed above, but it provides many powerful features, such as time-travel debugging, that can make it a great choice for larger applications.

Using MobX:

The fourth way to manage the state is to use MobX. MobX is another state management library that can be used with React. It is based on the concept of reactive programming and uses observables to track changes to the state of your application.

With MobX, you define any value that can change as an observable. This means you can track when that value changes, and automatically re-render your components when it does.

Like Redux, MobX can be a bit more complex to set up and use than the useState() hook or the built-in context API, but it can provide some powerful features and can be a great choice for larger applications.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, there are several ways to manage state in your React applications, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. If you're just getting started, the built-in useState() hook or context API might be the best place to start, as they are relatively easy to use and provide basic functionality for state management.

If you need more advanced features or have a larger application, Redux or MobX might be a better choice. Ultimately, the choice will depend on your specific use case and the needs of your application.
