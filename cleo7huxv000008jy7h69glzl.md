**API** stands for **"Application Programming Interface"**. It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications.

\=&gt; An API is a tool that software developers use to allow different programs to talk to each other. Are how different software components can communicate and exchange information with each other.

\=&gt; APIs can be used to provide access to various types of services, such as web services, databases, operating systems, hardware devices, and more.

\=&gt; They can be classified into two main types: 1) **Internal APIs and 2)External APIs.**

# 1) **Internal APIs:**

Internal APIs are used within a company or organization to allow different teams to build software applications that work together. They can be used to expose data or functionality between different teams, departments, or services within an organization to share data or functionality.

**Employee Directory API:** This API could be used by different teams within the company to access employee data, such as names, job titles, departments, and contact information.

**Employee Data API:** the HR team might use the API to update employee data in the directory, while the IT team might use the API to integrate the directory into their internal applications, such as email or chat systems. The marketing team might also use the API to pull data on employees for creating internal newsletters or communications.

**Use of Internal** **API**s

This can help to improve efficiency, reduce duplication of effort, and increase collaboration between different teams or departments.

The employee directory API would be an internal API because it is only used within the company and is not made publicly available to external developers.

**Disadvantages:**

Apis would be designed to meet the specific needs of the company and would not need to be as well-documented or as stable as an external API.

Since internal APIs are only used within an organization, they do not need to be as well-documented or as stable as external APIs. This means that they can be more flexible and can be updated or changed more frequently to meet the needs of the organization.

# **2) External APIs.**

External APIs are APIs that are made publicly available by a company or organization for third-party developers to use. These APIs allow external developers to build software applications that interact with a particular service or platform.

**Google Maps API:** The Google Maps API is an external API that allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications. Developers can use the API to display maps, search for places, and get directions within their own applications. The API provides a set of functions that developers can call from their code to access Google Maps functionality.

**Twitter API:** The Twitter API allows developers to access Twitter data and functionality, such as searching for tweets, posting tweets, and accessing user data. Developers can use the Twitter API to build applications that interact with Twitter, such as social media management tools, analytics tools, and chatbots.

**External APIs** are important because they allow developers to build applications that leverage the functionality of other services or platforms without having to build everything from scratch.

**Use of External APIs**

This can help to speed up development time, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of the application.

External APIs can also help to create new business opportunities for companies that provide them, by allowing third-party developers to build innovative applications on top of their services.

**Summary**

Both internal and external APIs are essential to modern software development and allow developers to create applications that leverage the functionality of other software components or services without having to build everything from scratch.

**Note:** Apis can be used internally within a company or made publicly available for external developers to use
