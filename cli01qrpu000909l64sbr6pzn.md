An operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. It provides an environment in which a user can execute programs and interacts with the computer system.

The **primary goal** of an operating system is to make the computer system convenient to use.

A **secondary goal** is to manage the computer hardware in an effective manner.

Operating systems include UNIX, MACH, MS-DOS, MS WINDOWS, WINDOWS NT OS/2, and MAC OS.

It is an essential part of almost every computer system, and without it, the user would not be able to interact with the computer hardware.

A computer system can be divided into four components: **hardware, operating system, system software, and** [**application software**](https://www.amazon.in/Computer-Software-Applications-Ramesh-Bangia/dp/8131806111/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1FPELWXWLR58Q&keywords=Application+Software&qid=1684832254&s=books&sprefix=application+software%2Cstripbooks%2C308&sr=1-2).

System software includes the operating system and other software that provides services to the user, while application software includes programs that users run to perform specific tasks.

**Components of a computer system:**

A computer system can be divided into four major components, which are:

1. **Hardware:** These are the physical components of a computer system, including the central processing unit (CPU), input devices like a keyboard and mouse, output devices like a monitor and printer, storage devices like a hard drive and flash drives, and other components like motherboard, graphics card, and power supply unit.
    
2. [**Operating System**](https://www.amazon.in/Operating-System-Principles-Silberschatz/dp/8126509627)**:** An operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. It provides an environment in which a user can execute programs and interacts with the computer system. The primary goal of an operating system is to make the computer system convenient to use, while the secondary goal is to manage the computer hardware in an effective manner.
    
3. [**System Software**](https://www.amazon.in/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3J5R7RHUKWY92&keywords=System+Software&qid=1684832196&s=books&sprefix=system+software%2Cstripbooks%2C281&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)**:** System software includes the operating system and other software that provides services to the user, such as utilities, drivers, and maintenance programs.
    
4. [Application Software](https://www.amazon.in/Elementary-Computer-Application-Softwares-Prakash/dp/9388724690/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1FPELWXWLR58Q&keywords=Application+Software&qid=1684832254&s=books&sprefix=application+software%2Cstripbooks%2C308&sr=1-1): Application software includes programs that users run to perform specific tasks like word processing, playing games, browsing the internet, or managing finances. These programs are designed to accomplish specific goals, unlike system software, which is more general in nature.
