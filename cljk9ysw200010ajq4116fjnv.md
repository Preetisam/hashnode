Props drilling refers to the process of passing props from a parent component to a nested child component through multiple levels of components in the component tree. This can happen when a prop value needs to be accessed by a deeply nested component that is not directly connected to the parent component.

Props drilling can sometimes lead to code that is difficult to maintain and can create unnecessary dependencies between components. It can be mitigated by using alternative approaches such as context or state management libraries like Redux.

Here's an example to illustrate props drilling:

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const message = 'Hello from Parent';

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent message={message} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;

// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import GrandchildComponent from './GrandchildComponent';

const ChildComponent = ({ message }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <GrandchildComponent message={message} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent;

// GrandchildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const GrandchildComponent = ({ message }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{message}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default GrandchildComponent;
```

In the above example, `ParentComponent` passes the `message` prop down to `ChildComponent`, which in turn passes it down to `GrandchildComponent`. The `message` prop is accessed by `GrandchildComponent` through props drilling.

While props drilling is a simple and straightforward way to pass data between components, it can become cumbersome when the component hierarchy grows larger. In such cases, alternative solutions like context or state management libraries can provide a more efficient and scalable approach.
