Well, why re-rendering every component a thousand times when it's not necessary? And if you are also binding late that's a nightmare!

`shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method in React that allows you to optimize the rendering performance of your component. When `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `false`, React skips the rendering of that component.

By default, every time a component receives new props, React will trigger a re-render. However, in some cases, it might not be necessary to re-render the component. This is where `shouldComponentUpdate` comes into play. You can use this method to tell React whether or not to re-render your component based on the new props and state.

If your component is re-rendering too often and causing performance issues, you can implement `shouldComponentUpdate` it to prevent unnecessary re-renders. You can compare the current props and state with the new props and state to see if they are different. If they are the same, you can return `false` from `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent the re-render.

Regarding late binding, it can cause performance issues because it creates a new function every time the component is rendered. This means that if a component re-renders frequently, it can create a lot of new functions, which can impact performance.

To avoid late binding, you can use arrow functions instead of normal functions, or you can bind the function in the constructor. By doing this, you ensure that the function is only created once and not every time the component is re-rendered. This can help improve the performance of your component.
