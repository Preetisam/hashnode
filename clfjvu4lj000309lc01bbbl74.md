binary tree

Hello and welcome to my blog! I am thrilled to have you here and I hope you are enjoying the content that I am sharing. My main goal with this blog is to provide useful information on various topics, from web development to technology and beyond.

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child.

A full binary tree, also known as a proper binary tree, is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. In other words, all nodes in a full binary tree have either 0 or 2 children.

On the other hand, a complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. In other words, all nodes on every level of a complete binary tree are filled, except possibly the last level and all nodes on the last level are filled from left to right.

**Note:** So, the main difference between a full binary tree and a complete binary tree is that in a full binary tree, every non-leaf node has exactly two children, while in a complete binary tree, the last level may not be completely filled, but all nodes on the last level are filled from left to right.

I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to leave a comment and let me know your thoughts. If there are any specific topics that you would like me to cover, don't hesitate to reach out and share your ideas.
