To store form values in a web application, there are several options available. Here are some common ways to store form values:

1. **Local state:** You can store the form values as the local state using the `useState()` hook in React, or similar state management tools in other frontend frameworks. This is a good option if you only need to store the form values temporarily within a component.
    
2. **Redux store:** You can store the form values in a centralized Redux store in React, or similar state management tools in other frontend frameworks. This is a good option if you need to share the form values across multiple components in your application.
    
3. **Context API:** You can use the React Context API to store the form values and make them accessible to any component that needs them. This is a good option if you need to share the form values across multiple components, but don't want to use a full-fledged state management tool like Redux.
    
4. **Server-side database:** You can store the form values in a server-side database using backend technologies like **Node.js, PHP, or Python**. This is a good option if you need to persist the form values beyond the lifetime of the application or need to share them across multiple sessions.
    

**Note:** The choice of storage mechanism depends on your specific use case, the complexity of your application, and the performance requirements.
