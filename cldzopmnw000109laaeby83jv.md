JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used by React to define UI components as a combination of HTML-like syntax and JavaScript. While JSX can be used without React, it is typically associated with React and used as a way to build UI components in React applications.

If you want to use JSX without React, you would need to use a tool to transpile the JSX code into JavaScript that can run in a browser or other JavaScript environment. There are several transpilers available, such as Babel, that can perform this transformation.

However, it's worth noting that JSX was designed to be used with React, and its features and syntax are optimized for building UI components in React. If you're not using React, you may be better off using plain JavaScript to define your UI components.
