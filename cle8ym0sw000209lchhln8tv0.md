**The Features divs positioned**

Without seeing the actual code or design, it's difficult to say for sure why the feature divs are positioned below each other. However, there are a few reasons why this might be the case:

The divs are styled with a display property of block, which by default takes up the entire width of the container and forces subsequent elements to be displayed on a new line.

1) The divs are styled with a fixed height, which means they have a specific vertical size and cannot be overlapped with other elements.

2) The divs are positioned using a float property, a technique used for wrapping text around an element. When multiple divs are floated, they are typically positioned side-by-side until there's no more room, and then they're pushed to a new line.

3) These are some common reasons why divs might be positioned below each other, but it's always best to inspect the code and CSS to understand the exact reason.

The most common reason is the display property of the div, which is set to "block" by default. This means that the div takes up the full width of its parent container and forces the subsequent elements to be displayed on a new line. If the div's height is set to a fixed value, it will also contribute to the element being displayed on a new line.

Additionally, the float property can also be a reason for the div to be positioned below other divs. When multiple divs are floated, they're typically positioned side-by-side until there's no more room, and then they're pushed to a new line. This can cause the div to be positioned below other divs, depending on the width of the parent container and the size of the floated elements.

It's always best to inspect the code and CSS to determine the exact reason for the divs being positioned below each other, as it may vary from case to case.
