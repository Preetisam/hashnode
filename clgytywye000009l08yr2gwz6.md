Authentication is the process of identifying the user or entity that is attempting to access a system, application or a resource. The goal of authentication is to determine whether the user or entity is who they claim to be, and based on that, either grant or deny access to the requested system, application or resource.

Authentication typically involves asking for some form of credentials, such as a username and password or other forms of secure tokens, like biometric data, smart cards or digital certificates. These credentials are then verified against a trusted source, such as a database of authorized users or an external identity provider.

The main purpose of authentication is to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities have access to sensitive data or resources. Strong authentication mechanisms and protocols are essential to ensure the security and privacy of user data and to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of critical infrastructure.

Some common examples of authentication mechanisms include two-factor authentication, where users are required to provide a password and a one-time use code sent to their mobile phone, and multi-factor authentication which combines two or more authentication mechanisms to confirm the userâ€™s identity.
