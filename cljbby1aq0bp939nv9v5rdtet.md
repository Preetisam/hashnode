**Gray-box testing** is a software testing methodology that combines the elements of black-box testing and white-box testing. It involves testing the software system with partial knowledge of its internal workings and functionality. The tester performing gray-box testing has access to limited or partial knowledge of the internal workings of the system, such as knowledge of data structures and algorithms, but may not have complete access to the source code.

Gray-box testing is a way to test the software application from the perspective of both the developer and the end user. The purpose of gray-box testing is to identify both functional and non-functional issues in the system, such as data validation, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and usability problems.

**Gray Box End-to-End Testing?**

Gray-box testing is often used in testing web-based applications and databases. It can be done manually or with the help of automated testing tools. Gray-box testing is useful because it helps to find defects before the application is released to the end users. It also provides a higher level of testing than black-box testing but is less time-consuming and less expensive than **white-box testing.**

**Jest** is a popular JavaScript testing framework that is widely used by developers for testing JavaScript applications. It is a powerful testing framework with a comprehensive set of features that make it easy to test any JavaScript code, including React components, Redux reducers, and utility functions. *Jest provides features like test suites, test cases, test runners, matchers, and helpers that help developers write reliable and maintainable tests.*

**What is Detox?**

Detox is a *Gray-box End to End testing* framework for mobile applications that allows developers to test their apps on real mobile devices. It is a powerful testing tool that provides features like automatic synchronization with the app's state and the ability to interact with native elements. *Detox is particularly useful for testing complex, multi-screen mobile applications with stateful behavior.*

**Is Jest enough and what do you usually test?**

Generally, developers use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the app's quality. Unit tests are used to test individual code units such as functions, classes, or methods. Integration tests are used to test how different code units work together. End-to-end tests are used to test the entire user journey through the app, usually covering the happy path, edge cases, and common error scenarios.

In conclusion, Jest is a powerful testing framework that can be used to test a wide variety of JavaScript applications. Detox is a Gray-box End to End testing framework specifically designed to test mobile applications. Developers use a combination of testing types to ensure that the app's logic is always covered by tests.
