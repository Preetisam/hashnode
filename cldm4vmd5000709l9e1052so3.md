Git and GitHub are related but separate tools.

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in files, typically used for software development. It allows users to keep a history of their project files, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others by sharing changes.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development using Git. It provides features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and a wiki for documentation. It also has a large community of users who can contribute to and use each other's projects.

In summary, Git is the tool, while GitHub is the platform that makes Git easier to use and provides additional features for collaboration and project management.
